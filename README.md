I am unhappy with our educational system and the way schools are organized. I think that there are many issues that can be easily fixed by reconsidering the students & teachers workflow and optimizing them.

Besides the obvious idiocy like printing out forests worth of paper for tests, which will then be thrown away immediately after they have been corrected, there are apparent issues like wasting hours and hours of time with redundant work that no one benefits from. Just think of how many times a teacher has to redo a panel on the blackboard. We should be able to create and share documents easily.
 
We can improve this situation and make it possible for both teachers & students to use their time in a more efficient and fun way. 

I have 4 separate applications in mind

##Fundisa-Center

This is the management area for a Fundisa network used in a school. Here we can organize teachers & students accounts, collect data, organize classes and similiar stuff.

## Fundisa-Teacher

Every teacher can log into this application with their private credentials. This is the place where documents and tests are created and shared with a class, tasks are corrected and the overall progress is logged. 

##Fundisa-Student

This is the counterpart of Fundisa-Teacher used by students. I would like this to be a single resource of all necesseary papers, tests, tasks and all that remains for a organized, well-to-do school experience. Students should be able to share certain documents and edit them together while the application also serves as the single venue of all school related work.

##Fundisa-Server

All of the above is backed by a server that is hosted by the school itself.
